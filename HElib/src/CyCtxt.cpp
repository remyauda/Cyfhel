 *  Cyfhel is a C++ library that creates an abstraction over the basic
 *  functionalities of HElib as a Homomorphic Encryption library, such as
 *  addition, multiplication, scalar product and others.
 *
 *  Cyfhel implements a higher level of abstraction than HElib, and handles
 *  Cyphertexts using an unordered map (key-value pairs) that is accessed
 *  via keys of type string. This is done in order to manage Cyphertext
 *  using references (the keys), which will allow Cyfhel to work only
 *  using strings (keeping the Cyphertexts in C++). Cyfhel also compresses
 *  the Context setup and Key generation into one single KeyGen function
 *  with multiple parameter selection.
